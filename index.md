  <b>About this website.</b>
</h1>

Hello there, and welcome to my projects website. Here, you'll find everything I've made, and the code to go along with them. Everything is separated by language, and within those language pages everything is separated by project. Within each project page you will find the description of the project (what it does), screenshots of its functionality, and code for you to try out yourself! Enjoy!
