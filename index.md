# -> About this. <-

Hey there, I love to create. I have created various projects in various languages, including R. On here, my website, I have organized my projects by language, and then by the project. On each project page, you will find information about the project (what it does), screenshots showcasing how it works, and the code available for download to try it out for yourself. Enjoy!
